# Tailwind-CSS

Tailwind-CSS is like a set of building blocks for styling websites. Instead of writing custom styles in a seperate CSS file you can use ready-made classes directly in your HTML to style elements. It's like having a box of tools and you pick the tools (classes) you need for the job (styling). This makes it easier to create and maintain the look of your website without having to write a lot of custom code.
